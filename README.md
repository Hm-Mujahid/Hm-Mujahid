## üöÄ Projects

Here are some projects I‚Äôve worked on. (Feel free to add links/descriptions.)

- ChessVision ‚Äì Built an ML-based tool to recognize chess puzzles from images and generate best-move solutions.
                Implemented image-to-FEN mapping and integrated a chess engine for automated puzzle solving.
  
- Rubi-Flow ‚Äì Developed a system to detect Rubik‚Äôs Cube faces from images and compute optimal solving steps.
              Implemented state recognition + Kociemba‚Äôs algorithm to output a complete solution sequence.
  
- AirCursor - Built a vision-based system to control the mouse pointer using finger movements without physical devices.
              Implemented hand landmark detection + gesture mapping for smooth cursor movement and click simulation.

- [Portfolio Website](https://hm-mujahid.github.io/) ‚Äì Showcases my work, r√©sum√©, skills & contact info.
